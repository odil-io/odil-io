Generally speaking idea's about anything. Possible or not.

## Automation

Everything about Automation. Automate EVERYTHING.

### Deploy Flow

How would this work? Every commit you make is sure to be free of silly mistakes (QA/CS) and should at least 'work' in the sense that it doesn't cause any warnings or fatal errors.

- Do work locally
  - During work: QA/CS/Linting
- pre-commit: Local CS:OK
- commit work to repo
- repo does Quality Assurance
- repo does Code Sniffing
- repo does Deploy/CI after QA:OK and CS:OK

**WP**: Automatically make a test page available for developers. Sometimes you _do_ want to test on production.

## Logging

- Git Logger, Log _all_ activity on 'date'.
