Hi,

I'm a mostly self taught web developer with most of my experience being WordPress and PHP both Back- and Frontend. I have interests in science and technology. Also known as S.T.E.M but I don't like Math that much so more like S.T.E amirite.
So without further ado, check out my repo's.

Currently: working on a protable system to control RGB LED's inside percussion instruments to light up their drums according to a set of presets and custom values via a colorwheel. All remotely controlled and wireless via EPS-32's.
