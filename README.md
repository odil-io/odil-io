Hi,

I'm a mostly self taught web developer with interests in science and technology. 

**Currently**: A side project with ESP-32's, Updating my site to something way better (imho), Getting my shit together, designing a mini-keypad for personal streaming use, getting a 3D printing setup done (based on Voron) and seting up streaming for both my workdesk and my PC for game streaming.
